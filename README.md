# DiaXpert

This code predicts whether a person is diabetic based on their age, pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level and BMI. The app also provides a visualization of the patient's data along with the predicted outcome. This can be helpful for understanding the factors that contributed to the prediction.
